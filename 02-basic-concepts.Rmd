# Basic Concepts {#ch2}

You've done an absolutely wonderful job on Flipgrid and Hypothesis! So excited to see you joining this course from near (LES Building) and far (yes **Pauline**, I am talking about you!).  From our Flipgrid videos, I was amazed by the range of perspectives you're bringing into this class! As many of you mentioned in your videos, we're going to learn a lot from each other.

**In this week, we will:**

1. Explore social network perspectives
2. Become familiar with basic SNA concepts
3. Draft an initial SNA project idea and share out

## Understanding SNA in Educational Research

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXxpgQAYfTE?list=PLjwvT6cNsD_12ghorqyZ1LHjdvmEhm6N-" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Three levels of considerations

In the previous video, I described three levels of considerations that educational researchers often need to be aware of. You could find more information in text such as [@Niglas2010-tr] or some other research methodology courses. Please note that this framework was *constructed* to help us grapple with the complex terrain of research, and it is highly debatable. 

Below, I try to re-iterate the key message of the video -- but from the bottom up:

- **m**, or methods/techniques: The "small *m*" in SNA constitutes methods or techniques we apply in SNA research. Imagine we are using SNA to investigate friendship of a network of high-schoolers (think about "Gossip Girls" if you've watched that TV series). A technique in this SNA research could be a questionnaire used to collect friendship data among students; it could be the [force-directed layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) we use to visualize this network; it could be the measure of *betweenness centrality* we use to characterize high-schoolers; it could also be a network modeling algorithm we apply to model the flow of gossips. In a nutshell, these techniques are more about **what** we concretely do in an SNA research.

- **M**: When SNA is referred to as a "big *M*" Methodology, it is treated as a systematic approach of investigating a phenomenon. Beyond simply applying these techniques, a methodology is also concerned with **why** a technique gets used. In other words, understanding SNA as a methodology means learning to make informed decisions in any stage of an SNA project. For example, why using a questionnaire instead of observations or interviews? In which cases should one use a *circle layout* instead of a force-directed layout? Why a specific SNA measure is appropriate for addressing a research question? In a nutshell, the big *M* is concerned with **how** knowledge could be best gained by following many SNA methodologists and researchers have created so far. 

- **P**, worldviews, philosophical schools of thoughts, paradigms: In SNA, some scholars go further to argue SNA offers a unique way of "seeing the world." In Carolan (2014) chapter 2 you will read about the **relational perspective** that represent a particular worldview that emphasizes relations instead of attributes. You will also read about **relational realism** that is referred to as an ontology grounding SNA. To a great extent, SNA offers a new research paradigm. As put by Barry Wellman, a guru in SNA from the University of Toronto, "It is a comprehensive paradigmatic way of taking social structure seriously by studying directly how patterns of ties allocate resources in a social system" (see, Carolan, 2014, p. 33).

In this course, we are mostly concerned with the "big M" level. We will not dive too deep into the **P** level, and we will not settle with specific techniques. Together, we will learn how to apply various techniques to systematically produce knowledge about a phenomenon.

## Basic Concepts

Last week, you've identified a wide range of terms from course readings. See the Hypo search results below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag:snaed%20tag:term", 
  height = "400px")
```

This week, we will be immersed in a number of key SNA concepts. In the following video, I "glide over" some basic terms that are often used in SNA. You do not need to memorize them all. As a matter of fact, I see those terms existing as a network (see the image below); as you "unlock" one term, you are also activating others. So spend time on some terms, and you're implicitly learning about others.

## Week 2 Activities

**Due by Jan 30, 11:59PM**

### Read & Annotate

**Read**:

- [Carolan, ch. 2](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n2.xml), starting from "The Integration of Theory and Method" (pp. 32--42)
- [Carolan, ch. 3](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n3.xml)

**Annotate** using Hypo. Like Week 1, please try to do at least one entry for each of the following:

- Annotate **an SNA term** you find interesting/useful, and provide a definition. Use tags `term` and `SNAEd` in your annotation
- Annotate **an example application** of SNA in readings, and explain how you find it useful or interesting. Use tags `application` and `SNAEd` in your annotation
- **Reply to annotations** made by others

### Draft an intial project idea

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pe80-YWFetE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

1. In **Slack**, in the `assignments` channel, **share a post** describing your initial project idea. 

  - In your post, use 3 paragraphs to (1) describe the **context**, (2) articulate the **phenomenon** and introduce your key **question(s)**, and (3) describe any initial thoughts (if any) on using SNA in this project. 
  - Not sure how to compose a post? Check this [help page](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203950418-Compose-a-post).

2. **Read each other's posts**. Please **leave comments** (and emojis if you want) to "praise" and/or "push" each other.

(If you find someone who share a similar interest with you, you're encouraged to form a group. Slack is always there for you to communicate and collaborate with each other!)

Have a wonderful week!
