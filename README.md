This is a course portal developed using [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) for my *Social Network Analysis in Education* class at the Univerity of Minnesota. The compiled instance is hosted at https://bookdown.org/chen/snaEd.

## Usage

To push an update to Bookdown.org, run `bookdown::publish_book(name = "snaEd", account = "chen", render = "local")`. Note that you will need to use your own account.

Check [this example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/tree/master/inst/examples) for detailed usage of **bookdown**.
