# Novel Approaches and Analytics {#ch13}

As we are coming to the final two weeks of this course, I hope we are all coming to appreciate the power of SNA and the `relational` perspective in general. It is totally fine if you are 'still' wrestling with certain areas of SNA, as every one of us brings unique background into this course and may either need extra time to grasp certain concepts/techniques or wish to engage more deeply with certain areas. As the instructor, I will be most happy if this course would serve as a starting point for your journey with SNA.

SNA and network analysis in general are constantly evolving. The potential to apply SNA is endless. This week, we will explore some "unusual" use of SNA and, in some cases, a combination of SNA with other techniques. Please watch the video to get started.

Note: I was unable to introduce activities in the video. Please proceed to the next page for detailed information, which should be fairly straightforward.

## Resources and Activities

In this week, each of us will:

1. Identify/select a novel SNA-based approach, technique or tool
2. Review and critique the choose approach or tool for our class

### Resources

You have absolute freedom in choosing a novel SNA-based approach, technique or tool. Below I provide a list of 'candidates' based on my areas of interest, which may not overlap with yours. 

When making your choice, you should have a vague idea about what 'novelty' means to you. There is no standards to judge novelty in this course but it would be helpful if you can somehow justify your choice.

### Reflect and Share

After spending time with resources related to the identified SNA-based innovation, you are expected to **reflect on a few aspects**:

1. Which traditional SNA techniques are reflected in this innovation?
2. Which 'cool' or 'novel' elements are introduced by this innovation compared to traditional SNA?
3. Which practical and/or scholarly value does this innovation introduce?

**Post your reflection on the Slack `assignment` channel**. A mini video presentation is preferred this time so that you're warming up for our final project presentations.

Have fun and I look forward to learning from your explorations!
