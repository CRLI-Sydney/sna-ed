## Why Social Network Analysis?

### Perspectives from colleagues

We come together to learn (more) about social network analysis (SNA) -- for various reasons. In preparation for the class, I invited three colleagues who're all doing interesting work with SNA to share a bit about their experiences (note some videos are only visible for UMN viewers):

**Alejandro Andrade**, PhD from Indiana University, now Data Scientist at ACT

<!-- ### Bodong's SNA journey -->

<!-- I myself was first exposed to SNA in 2007, when there was a distance class offered at Peking University (where I completed my master's) in collaboration with another university in the Netherlands. Looking backwards, I don't think I've learned much from that class, mostly because I didn't see a clear relevance between my work then and SNA.  -->
<!-- During my doctoral studies in Toronto, I became increasingly intrigued by SNA (and network analysis in general), because 1) the world is becomming increasingly inter-connected; 2) many researchers I read use SNA in many cool ways; and 3) SNA could offer insights to improve learning and teaching. So since then, I've been self-teaching myself about SNA, with help from a vast body of online resources. It has been a long journey with a lot of exploration and tinkering, which I absolutely enjoyed.  -->

<!-- Now I engage with SNA for three major reasons: 1) to apply 'classic' SNA techniques in my empirical work; 2) to develop formative feedback tools focusing on social aspects of learning; and 3) to develop network-based approaches to uncover holistic insights about learning, by combining multiple analytical aspects (social, temporal, semantic) together. I consider myself constantly learning new thigns about SNA, and look forward to this learning journey with everyone in the class! -->

## Syllabus

The most <a href="http://bit.ly/sna-syl-19" target="_blank">current syllabus</a> will always available online. 

In Week 1, please read the Syllabus in full. Ask questions, if any, on the `#q_and_a` channel on Slack or annotate the syllabus using Hypothes.is. 

## Digital learning environments {#digital}

This is a **fully online** class. An online course does not need to be about watching videos and answering quizzes. To foster rich learning experiences, we will be using several technological tools to foster social, collaborative learning. Depending on your familiarity with these tools, there could be a learning curve. So please spend time this week to familiarize yourself with them.

Below is a list of them and we could tweak the list when moving forward.

**Bookdown course site**. This website you're reading is built by myself using `Bookdown`. `Bookdown` is designed for writing books. While this site may evolve into an open textbook, I'm using it as our course portal.

Course resourses, usually organized by weeks, will be published here. Each chapter maps onto a week. Weekly course annoucements will be pushed to the class through Slack (more below). (If you are an 'Open Participant', just check this website every Tuesday!)

**Slack** (UMN Students Only). You will receive a link that invites you to join [our Slack community](https://la-mn.slack.com/). Course announcements are made on Slack. All sorts of class discussion will take place there as well. First time using Slack? Watch the video below and/or read this [brief introduction to Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9RJZMSsH7-g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To get started with Slack, get familiar with a few **Slack terms** you need to know [^3]:

- **Messages** or **Updates** — the basic message or status of Slack. Similar to Facebook updates, tweets, chats, etc.
- **Channels** — like separate rooms within the domain. They can be *public* or *private*. 
- **Direct Messages** — like DMs or private messages anywhere else.
- **Posts** — longer than a status update. Similar to a blog post or a Word document. Once it's shared to a *Channel*, folks can **comment** on it or even **edit** it if the owner allows. 
- **Snippets** — Chunks of syntax-highlighted code for when that’s the thing you need to share. We *might* use it.
- **\@replies** — much like on Twitter, used when you want to mention someone. You can \@everyone or \@channel.
- **emoji** — just like what you see everywhere.
- **Integrations** — Slack can 'talk' with many other systems. For example, you can post a doc from your Google Drive when submitting an assignment; you can type `/giphy` to share random gifs. I will explain more later. 

To learn more, check out the [Slack tutorials](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606-Using-Slack).

**Hypothes.is**. If you're a formal participant, you should have received a link that invites you to join a private Hypothes.is group. Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that enables us to discuss readings in a contextual manner. When annotating, please make sure our group name (**SNAEd**) is properly selected.  *Pro Tip*: Please try to use a same (or at least a smilar) username for Slack and Hypo so that we can match you in two spaces.

![](images/scopeselector-groupname.png)

If you are an Open Participant, please annotate publicly and make sure to tag your annotations with `SNAEd`. Otherwise, it will not be picked up by our [class feed](https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag%3ASNAEd).

To learn more, check out [Hypothesis Quick Start Guide for Students](https://hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/), and [a more complete Resource Guide for Students](https://hypothes.is/student-resource-guide/).

**Zoom**. We will host virtual meetings on Zoom from Week 7. Please make sure your computer has [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) installed (see the video below). Please test your Zoom setup in advance to make sure audio and video configurations work properly. You will receive a calendar invitation with details about joining our Zoom meetings.

**Twitter** (optional). If you tweet, like [me](https://twitter.com/bod0ng), please tag your tweets with `#SNAEd` as well. 

To demonstrate how Twitter could be useful, I bet you can learn more from [TechPizza](http://techpizza.org/twitter.php) than from this course (set Topic to be, for example, 'Text, Network Analysis' --> 'network:gephi').

**Google Drive**. Google Drive will be used for major assignment submissions. I will provide detailed feedback directly in your Google Docs, so it is important you use Google Drive. UMN offers free Drive access and unlimited storage. If you need help, check this OIT page: https://it.umn.edu/technology/google-drive

To submit an assignment through Slack, head to the #assignment Slack channel and click on the '+' button to pull out a menu with opitons of adding Drive files. You may need to authenticate Google Drive on Slack. See [help page](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205875058-Google-Drive-for-Slack).

<!-- ### Integrations -->

<!-- We are using multiple systems in this class. And I am fully aware that it may cause disorientation especially in the first one or two weeks. Please keep in mind Slack is the place for us to hang out, and other things -- course content on our course site, Hypo, Drive -- will be somehow integrated in our commucations on Slack. -->

<!-- - **Course site -> Slack**: When new content is published (weekly in most cases), I will send out an annoucement in the `#annoucement` channel. -->
<!-- - **Hypo -> Slack**: Hypo annotations properly posted using our `#SNAEd` tag will be notifed in Slack's `#hypo_feed` channel.  -->
<!-- - **Drive -> Slack**: You can directly add Drive files into Slack when submitting a 'larger' assignment (e.g., project paper, presentations, essays).  -->
<!-- - **Slack -> Email**: Depending on your preference settings, you will receive some notification emails from Slack. The default settings will email you Private Messages. You can change [your email preferences here](https://snaed.slack.com/account/notifications).  -->
