## Why Social Network Analysis?

We come together to learn more about Social Network Analysis (SNA) -- for various reasons. In preparation for the class, I invited three current graduate students -- Michael from UMich, Alejandro from Indiana, and Fan from UMN -- to share a bit about their experience:

I was first exposed to SNA in 2007, when there was a virtual class offered at Peking University (where I did my master's) in collaboration with another university in the Netherlands. Looking backwards, I don't think I've learned much from that class, mostly because I didn't have a clear sense about how SNA could be applicable to my own work. During my doctoral studies in Toronto, I became increasingly intrigued by SNA (and network analysis) in general because 1) learning (my main research interest) takes place in networks; 2) many researchers I read use SNA in various cool ways; and 3) SNA could offer real-time feedback to teachers and students as well. So since then, I've been self-teaching myself, with help of a vast body of resources online, about SNA. It has been a long journey with a lot of exploration and tinkering, which I absolutely enjoyed. Now I engage with SNA mostly for three purposes: 1) use 'traditional' SNA techniques in my empirical work; 2) develop formative feedback tools that focuse on social aspects of learning; and 3) develop network-based approaches to tie multiple analytical aspects (social, temporal, semantic) of learning together. I consider myself constantly learning new thigns about SNA, and look forward to this journey with everyone in the class!

## Syllabus

## Digital learning environments{#digital}

This is a primarily online class. We will use a range of digital tools to support our individual and group learning. Below is a list of them as I am planning for this course, and we can tweak the list as moving forward.

### Slack

`Slack` is a communication tool widely adopted by tech companies and is gaining traction in education more recently. It was originally created to cut emails. 

In this online class, we will greatly depend on Slack for class communications. I will use Slack to push out course annoucements, distribute materials, and all other stuff an instructor would normally do. Anyone in our Slack team should feel free to organize groups -- also called `channels` in Slack-ology. Class participants, including me, are expected to check Slack several times a week. 

Note that by default private messages will be forwarded to your email unless you customized your preferences otherwise. 

To sign up for our Slack team, go to: https://snaed.slack.com/signup

### Hypothes.is

Instead of making online posts out of the context, each week we will be making open annotations in Web documents using a cutting-edge tool named Hypothes.is (Hi hereafter). The tool has been used broadly in education, for example, for close reading in humanities [@Kennedy2016-qw]. In this class, the basic idea is we are going to engage with online materials (e.g., our textbook accessible from the libary) and interact with each other through reading & commenting on each other's annotations. 

Setting up Hi:

- Sign up for an account
- Install the browser plugin
- Join our private class group

Using Hi - important tips:

- Make sure you are posting to our private class group. Otherwise, your annotations are made to the Public Domain, and will not be picked up by our class feed.
- Use tags.
- Reply to each other's annotations. 

To sign up for our Hi group, visit: https://hypothes.is/groups/8Nxk21z5/snaed

Note: Please try to use a same username for Slack and Hi so that we will not get confused. 

### Twitter (optional)

If you tweet, like [me](https://twitter.com/bod0ng), please us #SNAED in tweets related to this class. 

To demonstrate how Twitter could be useful, I bet you can learn more from [TechPizza](http://techpizza.org/twitter.php) than from this course (set Topic to be, for example, 'Text, Network Analsysi' --> 'network:gephi').

### Google Drive

Google Drive will be used for major assignment submissions. UMN offers free Drive access and unlimited storage. If you need help, check this OIT page: https://it.umn.edu/technology/google-drive

In the #assignment Slack channel, click on the '+' button to pull out a menu with opitons of adding Drive files. You may need to authenticate Google Drive on Slack. See [help page](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205875058-Google-Drive-for-Slack).

### Integrations

- Slack -> Email: Depending on your preference settings, you will receive some notification emails from Slack.
- Hi -> Slack: Hi annotations properly posted to our group will be notifed in Slack's `#hi_feed` channel. 
- Drive -> Slack: You can directly add Drive files into Slack when submitting a 'larger' assignment (e.g., project paper, presentations, essays).
