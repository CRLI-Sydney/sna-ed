# Preface {-}

This site is the course portal of **CI5330 - Social Network Analysis in Education**, taught by **[Prof. Bodong Chen](http://bodong.ch)** at the University of Minnesota in Spring '17. 

Content on this site is actively built and refined throughout the semester. 

### Key links for the course: {-}

- **[Textbook Carolan (2014)](http://methods.sagepub.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education)**. *Note*: UMN library access required.
- [**Slack team**](https://snaed.slack.com/): We use Slack for course "management", aka. announcements, commucations, chats, small group work, etc.
- [**Hypothesis** course group](https://hypothes.is/groups/8Nxk21z5/snaed): We interact on top of web materials (including the textbook) during this course. Hypothesis is a cutting-edge, open-source *web annotation* tool, which is used more and more broadly [by educators](https://hypothes.is/education/) in the past two years.
- Optional - [**Twitter** hashtag #SNAEd](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23snaed): You can tweet about this course using #SNAEd.

## Why not Moodle for this course? {-}

To learn social network analysis (SNA) -- and many other stuff -- I believe the best way is to 'live' with it. That is, the best way to learn SNA is to seize every opportunity of applying SNA in one's own learning journey. This philosophy leads to two major reasons I'm piecing together a learning environment by myself:

- First, as an instructor I wish to foster **social interactions** as much as possible. Traditional learning management systems like Moodle is limiting for this purpose.
- Second, to **practice SNA with our own 'learning traces'**, system log data[^1] need to be somehow exposed to users. Traditional systems are falling behind in this area.

If you haven't used these tools mentioned above, no worries. I will provide detailed guidelines to get you started (see Section \@ref(digital)). **Many of us would be venturing out of our comfort zones.** (SO DO I -- because this is the first time I am doing this :-).) I hope we will all learn a great deal about SNA and beyond.

Have fun!

[^1]: I treat 'data' as [plural](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/data) in the course.

## Ways to contribute to this site {-}

This is the first time I am offering this course and teaching in such an 'open' manner. By making this course site open, I hope it could be useful beyond our current class. So I'd appreciate your help to continually improve the site.

1. The best way to contribute to this site is to annotate it using [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/). For example, to point out a possible spelling error, you can highlight the error and include two tags -- `SNAEd` and `issues` -- in your annotation.
2. The second best way is to report a `New Issue` on this website's [Github issues page](https://github.com/meefen/sna-ed/issues).
3. If you're Github-savvy, please consider forking the [Github repository](https://github.com/meefen/sna-ed/), making edits, and sending me a pull request.
4. If none of those options work for you, simply drop me an email at chenbd\@umn.edu.
