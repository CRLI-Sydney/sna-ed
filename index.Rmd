This site, or book, is the course portal of `CI5330 - Social Network Analysis in Education`, offered by Prof Bodong Chen at the University of Minnesota in Spring '17. 

Content on this site will be actively built and refined throughout the semester.

## Why not Moodle?

To learn social network analysis (SNA) -- and many other stuff -- I believe the best way is to 'live' with it. That is, the best way to learn SNA is to seize every opportunity of applying SNA in one's own learning journey. This philosophy leads to two major reasons I'm piecing together a learning system by myself:

- First, as an instructor I wish to foster social interactions as much as possible. Traditional learning management systems like Moodle is limiting for this purpose.
- Second, to practice SNA with our own `trace data`, system log data[^1] need to be somehow 'exposed' to users. Traditional systems are falling behind in this area.

If you haven't used these tools listed above, no worries. I will provide detailed guidance to get you started (see Section \@ref(digital)). It is expected that many of us are venturing out our comfort zones. SO DO I! This is the first time I am doing this :-). I hope we will all learn a great deal about and beyond SNA.

Have fun!
