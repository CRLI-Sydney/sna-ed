                   frequently appear as subsets of a set of objects. Over the
                   past century a number of descriptive statistics have been
                   developed to construct network structure from such data.
                   However, these measures lack a generating mechanism that
                   links the inferred network structure to the observed groups.
                   To address this issue, we propose a model-based approach
                   called the Hub Model which assumes that every observed group
                   has a leader and that the leader has brought together the
                   other members of the group. The performance of Hub Models is
                   demonstrated by simulation studies. We apply this model to
                   infer the relationships among Senators serving in the 110th

  abstract  = "The Third Edition of this best-selling text has been fully
               revised and updated to include coverage of the many developments
               on social network analysis (SNA) over the last decade. Written
               in a clear and accessible style, the book introduces these
               topics to newcomers and non-specialists and gives sufficient
               detail for more advanced users of social network analysis.
               Throughout the book, key ideas are discussed in relation to the
               principal software programs available for SNA. The book provides
               a comprehensive overview of the field, outlining both its
               theoretical basis and its key techniques. Drawing from the core
               ideas of points, lines and paths, John Scott builds a framework
               of network analysis that covers such measures as density,
               centrality, clustering, centralisation, and spatialisation. He
               identifies the various types of clique, component, and circle
               into which networks are formed, and he outlines an approach to
               socially structured positions within networks. A completely new
               chapter in this edition discusses recent work on network
               dynamics and methods for studying change over time. A final
               chapter discusses approaches to network visualisation. This is
               an excellent resource for researchers across the social sciences
               and for students of social theory and research methods.",

  author   = "Rivers, Caitlin M and Lewis, Bryan L",
  abstract = "In 2009 Ginsberg et al. reported using Google search query volume
              to estimate influenza activity in advance of traditional
              methodologies. It was a groundbreaking example of digital disease
              detection, and it still remains illustrative of the power of
              gathering data from the internet for important research. In
              recent years, the methodologies have been extended to include new
              topics and data sources; Twitter in particular has been used for
              surveillance of influenza-like-illnesses, political sentiments,
              and even behavioral risk factors like sentiments about childhood
              vaccination programs. As the research landscape continuously
              changes, the protection of human subjects in online research
              needs to keep pace. Here we propose a number of guidelines for
              ensuring that the work done by digital researchers is supported
              by ethical-use principles. Our proposed guidelines include: 1)
              Study designs using Twitter-derived data should be transparent
              and readily available to the public. 2) The context in which a
              tweet is sent should be respected by researchers. 3) All data
              that could be used to identify tweet authors, including
              geolocations, should be secured. 4) No information collected from
              Twitter should be used to procure more data about tweet authors
              from other sources. 5) Study designs that require data collection
              from a few individuals rather than aggregate analysis require
              Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 6) Researchers should
              adhere to a userâ€™s attempt to control his or her data by
              respecting privacy settings. As researchers, we believe that a
              discourse within the research community is needed to ensure
              protection of research subjects. These guidelines are offered to
              help start this discourse and to lay the foundations for the
              ethical use of Twitter data.",

  author   = "Wickham, Hadley",
  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready
              for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make
              data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper
              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
              consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
              with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",
