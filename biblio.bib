  abstract = "Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in
              network research across the physical and social sciences. For
              social scientists, the theory of networks has been a gold mine,
              yielding explanations for social phenomena in a wide variety of
              disciplines from psychology to economics. Here, we review the
              kinds of things that social scientists have tried to explain
              using social network analysis and provide a nutshell description
              of the basic assumptions, goals, and explanatory mechanisms
              prevalent in the field. We hope to contribute to a dialogue among
              researchers from across the physical and social sciences who
              share a common interest in understanding the antecedents and
              consequences of network phenomena.",
