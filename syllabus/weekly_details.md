#### Class 4: Collect and Manage Network Data

Summary: In this week we get practical, diving into different types of network data and techniques we could use to collect them. The instructor will introduce what network data may look like, and then demonstrate several handy ways of collecting network data in digital environments (e.g., Twitter, Facebook groups, and LMSs). We will introduce `Gephi`, a user-friendly tool for SNA, and learn to import data into it.
