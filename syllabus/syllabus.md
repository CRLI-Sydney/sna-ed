### Course Description

Sociocultural perspectives treat learning---in schools, organizational contexts, informal settings---as a fundamentally social process that takes place in specific social, cultural contexts. This view of learning necessitates methods that go beyond individual measurement to consider sociocultural processes in classrooms, schools, workplace, and so forth.

Social network analysis (SNA), a technique originated from early anthropology research, is concerned with social *affiliations* and *interactions* in social structures. SNA has garnered significant interests from educational researchers since decades ago, thanks to its affordances in answering research questions that are fundamentally social. As software for SNA is becoming more accessible, and as learning is increasingly supported by digital environments (which automatically capture social interaction data), SNA has become more feasible for educational researchers and practitioners.

This course provides an introduction to SNA, with a strong emphasis on its application in various educational settings. This course is organized into four major components/themes:

1. Foundations of the social network perspective
2. Techniques for collecting social network data in various settings
3. Techniques for analyzing and visualizing social networks
4. Practical guidelines on conducting SNA research in educational contexts, with considerations to theory use, ethics, and reproducibility

Throughout the course, students will apply SNA techniques to their own research agendas (e.g., social support of "low-performing" students, cyber-bulling on Instagram, collaboration in knowledge organizations, parent education through online platforms, the interaction between sports-event visitors with local residents, etc.). The hope for this course is to offer a brief introduction to the broad terrain of social network theory and research, so that students from a wide range of educational research areas would be prepared to apply SNA in their own research and practice.

### Course Learning Outcomes

A student who successfully completes this course will:

**Outcome 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the theory of social networks** by:

- Understanding the history of social network analysis
- Engaging in critical thinking regarding the applicability or inapplicability of social network theory to various educational contexts

**Outcome 2. Develop a command of the vocabulary and characterization of social network analysis** by:

- Using network terminology to identify nodes, edges and affiliations in graphical form through sociograms and in mathematical form through matrices
- Appropriately distinguishing between a complete network, network samples, ego networks, one-mode networks, and two-mode networks
- Calculating measures of connection at the level of the actor, the position/role, the tie, the dyad, the triad, the group and the whole network
- Utilizing the `Gephi` software package for social network analysis to assemble, organize, and transform network data

**Outcome 3. Demonstrate competence in applying social network analysis in educational research** by:

- Gathering social network data from online and offline sources
- Utilizing network analysis software (Gephi) to characterize social network structure in list, matrix, and graph forms
- Analyzing the impact of network structure on patterns through basic network statistics
- Applying social network analysis to answer research questions in education
- Becoming aware of ethics issues in social network analysis in educational settings

Since SNA has proven to be useful for investigating various aspects of education, these learning outcomes fit with CEHD's mission of using "multiculturalism and multidisciplinary scholarship to advance teaching and learning and to enhance the psychological, physical, and social development of children, youth, and adults across the lifespan in families, organizations, and communities."

### Who Should/Shouldn't Take This Course?

**No prerequisite is required.** Prior knowledge in sociocultural learning theories and statistics is recommended but not required.

Graduate students who feel driven to investigate educational phenomena and to shape the future of education should take this course. No matter whether you are studying effective teaching in classrooms, educational games, parent education, or creativity in organizations, SNA could potentially inform your scholarly inquiry and your agenda to transform practices. Discuss with your academic adviser whether this course would count as a research methodology course. 

Students who do not believe in sociocultural learning, or do not want to learn through social participation (e.g., weekly discussions) should **think twice** before taking this course. To learn SNA, we will "live" by experiencing the social aspects of learning and the power of networks in the human society.

In order to gain official course credit in this class, you must be a registered UMN graduate student. However, anyone is welcome to review the course materials available at the course's [public website](http://bodong.ch/sna-edu/).

### Course Requirements

#### Course participation and reading assignments

This is a "primarily online" class. [The course website](#) is the "go-to" place for course materials. Most course readings will be made accessible through the site.

The class would meet periodically depending on needs emerging from the class. Example needs include elaboration of key concepts, software demos, software practices, student presentations, etc.

Each week, students are expected to: 1) "openly annotate" and discuss course materials using Hypothes.is; and 2) craft brief reflection journals connecting class discussions with individual research interests. Discussions could be initiated by the instructor (e.g., responding to key reflective questions from readings) or, more ideally, everyone participating in the class (e.g., Q&A, posting some genius research ideas, sharing interesting use of social network analysis). Since this is a 3-credit course, please expect a 9-hour weekly workload.

#### Technical requirements

**Internet use**. All participants are expected to have access to the Internet in order to participate in this course. If you need technical support, consider visiting UMN OIT's [tech help walk-in locations](http://it.umn.edu/help/walk-in) on campus.

**Software**. To succeed in this class, you will need to use [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), [Slack](slack.com), and typical word processing software like Google Docs. Note that Gephi depends on Java, so your computer should support Java as well.  For [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the `sna` and `igraph` packages need to be installed, in addition to the standard R base installation. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is the recommended software environment. Detailed guidelines will be provided to help everyone get oriented. 

#### Deadlines & late assignments

All graded work in class must be completed by the due dates listed below in the Course Schedule section of this syllabus.

If you find a specific deadline not working for you or you need more time for an assignment, you can establish your own new deadline IF YOU CONTACT ME IN ADVANCE PRIOR TO THE INITIAL DEADLINE, provided that the new deadline would not disrupt your peers' work. However, **if I receive no PRIOR communication from you and you submit an assignment late, the assignment will be penalized at the rate of 10% per day** that it is submitted past the due date/time. Since we'll be moving fast in this class, discussion contributions that are more than two days late will result in zero points for that class session.

### Assignments and Grades

All assignments are subject to change. Details will be explained during the first class meeting.

- **Class Participation - f2f** (10%): Students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss required readings. Class participation grade is based not only on being present but also contributing to class discussion.
- **Course project**: The central goal of this course is to help students apply SNA to their educational research. To this end, each student will develop and continual refine a project idea throughout the course. A number of assignments are designed to help them move towards this goal:
	- *Project checkpoint 1* (5%): Each student will share an initial project idea and receive feedback from the instructor and peers.
	- *Data collection hands-on* (5%): Students will apply data collection techniques introduced in class to a real-world research scenario of their choice (e.g., their project scenario).
	- *Project checkpoint 2* (5%): Students will share their refined project ideas, with a concrete data collection plan fleshed out.
	- *Network analysis hands-on* (10%): Students will practice social network analysis using either an open dataset provided by the instructor or a dataset of their own. Research questions will be provided to guide the analysis to cover key aspects of SNA.
	- *Project final artifact* (20%): Each student will produce a project final artifact that represents preliminary results of their initial project ideas. The specific format of this artifact, e.g., a research paper, an online portfolio, or an interactive tool, is to be negotiated with the instructor.
	- *Project final presentation* (20%): Each student will deliver a project final presentation by the end of the class to showcase their projects. The presentation will be assessed by both peers and the instructor, in light of a rubric.
- **Reflection essay or e-portfolio** (10%): This assignment is designed to help students reflect on the journey of taking this course and examine possibilities of applying SNA in their ongoing and future research. Note: There will be no final exams for the class.
